                    <p>Professor Charles Babbage was a British mathematician, an original and innovative thinker and a pioneer of computing.Charles Babbage was born on 26 December 1791, probably in London, the son of a banker. He was often unwell as a child
                    and was educated mainly at home.</p>

                    <p>The 1820s saw Babbage work on his 'Difference Engine', a machine which could perform mathematical calculations. A
                    six-wheeled model was initially constructed and demonstrated to a number of audiences. He then developed plans for a
                    bigger, better, machine - Difference Engine 2. He also worked on another invention, the more complex Analytical Engine,
                    a revolutionary device on which his fame as a computer pioneer now largely rests. It was intended to be able to perform
                    any arithmetical calculation using punched cards that would deliver the instructions, as well as a memory unit to store
                    numbers and many other fundamental components of today's computers. The remarkable British mathematician Ada Lovelace
                    completed a program for the Analytical Engine but neither it, nor Difference Engine 2, were finished in Babbage's
                    lifetime.</p>

                    <p>Charles Babbage takes first steps in the construction of machines that would compute numbers. Charles Babbage proposed the construction of machines for use in the "computation of astronomical and mathematical
                    tables". Although the designs Babbage attempted to build never worked properly, they represent the first steps in the
                    construction of machines that would compute numbers faster and more accurately than humans performing the same job.</p>

                    Ada Byron, Later to be Countess Lovelace, first meets Charles Babbage in England. Babbage was known for his designs of
                    early calculating machines, including his "Difference Engine" (1823) and "Analytical Engine" (1834). Although he never
                    completed the machines, Babbage became a father of computing after his close friend Ada published a description of his
                    work.</p>

                    <p>Charles Babbage published a paper describing a mechanical computer that is now known as the Analytical Engine.
                    In December 1837, the British mathematician Charles Babbage published a paper describing a mechanical computer that is
                    now known as the Analytical Engine. Anyone intimate with the details of electronic computers will instantly recognize
                    the components of Babbage's machine. Although Babbage was designing with brass and iron, his Engine has a central
                    processing unit (which he called the mill) and a large amount of expandable memory (which he called the store). The
                    operation of the Engine is controlled by program stored on punched cards, and punched cards can also be used to input
                    data</p>

                    Babbage's Analytical Engine Passes the First Test
                    The Analytical Engine of Charles Babbage was never completed in his lifetime, but his son Henry Provost Babbage built
                    the mill portion of the machine from his father's drawings, and on January 21, 1888 computed multiples of pi to prove
                    the adequacy of the design. Perhaps this represents the first successful test of a portion of a modern computer.
                    Recently a portion of his earlier machine, the Difference Engine, was sold at auction by Christies of London to the
                    Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia.</p>
